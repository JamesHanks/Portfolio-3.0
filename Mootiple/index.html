			<h1>Pineapple Does Not Belong On Pizza</h1>
			<h2>Salami Steve | 15:00, 04/01/2019</h2>
			<p>Pineapple does not belong on pizza. Whilst I am not wholly against updates and iterations to classic food dishes—I’m a big supporter of Iceland’s Chicken Tikka Lasagne for example—pineapple going on pizza pushes it too far. The official definition states that pizzas could only be topped with vegetables, meat or fish (not including the base); pineapple is none of these.</p>

			<p>In almost every way (taste, smell and texture), the contrast is too much to make it an enjoyable meal. Pineapples are soggy, tangy and incredibly sweet, especially the tinned ones…</p>
