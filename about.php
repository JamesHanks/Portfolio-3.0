			<h2>Hello! My name is James and I’m a product designer and developer based in London.</h2>

			<p>I'm a recent graduate from <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/" target="blank">Brunel University London</a>, now working full-time at <a href="https://www.inktrap.co.uk/" target="blank">Inktrap</a>, a digital product studio. Before this, I was a Design Intern at <a href="http://panstudio.co.uk/" target="blank">PAN Studio</a>, where I worked on a variety of exciting projects such as <a href="http://www.runanempire.com/" target="blank">Run An Empire</a> and <a href="https://www.hellolamppost.co.uk/" target="blank">Hello Lamp Post.</a></p>

			<p>A firm believer in the value of empathy, I believe that when applied to design and technology, it can form incredible things that make a genuinely positive impact on the world we live in.</p>

			<p>If you would like to collaborate in some way or just chat, please email me at <a href="mailto:contact@jameshanks.net">contact@jameshanks.net</a>. I’ll do my best to respond as quickly as possible!</p>
