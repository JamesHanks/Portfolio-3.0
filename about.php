			<h2>Hello! My name is James and I’m a designer and developer based in London.</h2>

			<p>I’m a final year BSc Digital Design student at <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/" target="blank">Brunel University London</a>, having just completed my placement year working at <a href="http://panstudio.co.uk/" target="blank">PAN Studio</a>. I enjoy crafting elegant, user-centric and robust digital products.</p>

			<p>A firm believer in the value of empathy, I believe that when applied to design and technology, it can form incredible things that make a genuinely positive impact on the world we live in.</p>

			<p>If you would like to collaborate in some way or just chat, please email me at <a href="mailto:contact@jameshanks.net">contact@jameshanks.net</a>. I’ll do my best to respond as quickly as possible!</p>
