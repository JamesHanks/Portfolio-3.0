				<div class="column-1">
					<p>There are now more smart devices on earth than there are people. The constant stream of enticing content so easily available on such devices has had an enormously negative impact on sleep quantity and quality, on a global scale. The problem only appears to be increasing as smart devices become more commonplace due to them continuing to decrease in size and cost.</p>

					<p>During my research, I found that willpower alone was not enough for the majority of people to simply put down their devices before bed, even though they were well aware of how negatively such technology impacts on sleep. From creating stakeholder diagrams, I noticed how much power ISPs could have over the situation. This led me to consider designing a bespoke network to help tackle electronic insomnia.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="column-2">
					<p>My solution is a ‘sleep-friendly’ internet connection; this being a router and accompanying software that works with the user in order to improve the quality and quantity of their sleep.</p>

					<p>It provides a Wi-Fi connection that instead blocks the user from using the internet and diverts their device (mobile, desktop or even a smart speaker) to either a captive portal on a browser or pre-downloaded application.</p>

					<p>This application will guide the user through preparing for a good night’s sleep and help them relax before going to bed.</p>

					<p>My solution applies a cold-turkey approach to abstaining from internet usage but with a guidance system in place to support the user through it.</p>
